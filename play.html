            Two Gentlemen of Verona</h3>
            <h4>The same. Garden of JULIA's house. This is Scene 2</h4>

            
<p>Enter JULlA and LUCETTA</p>
<h6>JULIA</h6>
<p>But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?</p>
<h6>LUCETTA</h6>
<p>Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.</p>
<h6>JULIA</h6>
<p>Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
That every day with parle encounter me,
In thy opinion which is worthiest love?</p>
<h6>LUCETTA</h6>
<p>Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind
According to my shallow simple skill.</p>
<h6>JULIA</h6>
<p>What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?</p>
<h6>LUCETTA</h6>
<p>As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine;
But, were I you, he never should be mine.</p>
<h6>JULIA</h6>
<p>What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?</p>
<h6>LUCETTA</h6>
<p>Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.</p>
<h6>JULIA</h6>
<p>What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?</p>
